# aoc_2024
## rough plan for this year
okay, so i'm gonna do the easy phase in rust, using my python submission tools through the pyo3/maturin toolkit which is pretty easy to hook up.

i may look at branching out later into something like go, or a different language i've been meaning to get a bit better at
